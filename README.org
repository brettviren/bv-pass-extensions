#+title: some extensions to pass

Here are some extensions to [[https://www.passwordstore.org/][pass]].  They go in =~/.password-store/.extensions/=

* Install

#+begin_example
$ ./install.sh [force]
#+end_example

This will copy ~*.bash~ to the extensions directory if the file does not yet exist there.  If it exists and differs, a patch is emitted.  If "force" option, then the target is overwritten.
